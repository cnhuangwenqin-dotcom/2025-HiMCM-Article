## About the Work
This paper develops an integrated **AHP–TOPSIS–GHG Threshold** framework to evaluate the environmental sustainability of host cities for mega-sport events. Using the Super Bowl as a primary case study, the model quantifies energy use, water consumption, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions to support sustainability-oriented site selection. The framework is further extended to multi-venue events such as the Olympic Games.

Key features include:
- A structured indicator system covering energy, water, waste, and environmental management
- AHP-based weighting with consistency validation
- TOPSIS ranking enhanced by an independent GHG-emission threshold
- Robust sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses
- Extension to Olympic-scale, multi-venue events
